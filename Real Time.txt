Real Time (company):
-------------------
what is Server
--------------
definition: Server is a combination of hardware and software.

Developement Server/Environment:
--------------------------------
definition: Developement server is a combination of hardware and software which is mainly
            used to store the code written by the developer

Testing Server/ Test Bed
------------------------
definition: Testing server is a combination of hardware and software which is mainly used 
            to install the build/SW which needs to be tested.

Production Server:
-------------------
defintion: Production Server is a combination of hardware and software which is present in
           the customers place where in customers will use the sw and run the business.

1st cycle (5days)
-----------------
All developers will write the code for module 'A'and do WBT ,later sr dev/ DL will collect
the code , compile the code and compress the code into ZIP format/File and store the file
in developemet server in the below mentioned path

D://Build/B01.Zip

DL will send a mail to 'TL' stating Build B01.zip is ready for testing it consist of code
for module 'A' and wbt testing is done. 'TL' will connect to REX server and copy paste the
buildb01.zip into testing server, unzip and install the build/sw and give url,un and pwd to
test engineers and also TL will assign features to test engineers and ask them to start the
testing.Every TE will start doing functional testing for module 'A' and while testing if 
they find any defect they will loginto DTT and prepare defect report and give unique defect 
id and communicate defect to 'DL' and 'DL' will assign defect to respective developer.
parallely developers will be
1) copying old code
2) write code new module 'B'
3) Fix some 60 defect in module 'A'
4) WBT 

DL/Sr dev will collect the code , compile the code and compress the code into zip file and
store the file into 'REX' server and 'DL' will send a mail to 'TL' stating BuildB02.zip 
is ready for testing

2nd test cycle ( 5 days)
-------------------------
TL will connect to 'REX' server and copy paste Build B02.zip into 'testing server', unzip 
and uninstall the old build/sw and install the new build/sw and assign features to TE and
ask them to start the testing and TE will 
1) FT for module B
2) Integration testing between B and A
3) Retest defects in the module A
4) Test the old module 'A'

Note:
------
1) while retesting defect test engineer should retest the defect found by him not worry about 
   the defect found by other TE.

2) why TE will find new defects while testing old modules?

- Chances are the developers adding new module might affect old modules.
- Chances are there developers fixing defects in old modules might introduce new defects 
  in same old module
- Chances are there TE might have missed some defects in the previous cycle.

Like this way testing continues for many cycles and assume that minimum bunch of modules
are ready this is when testing team will talk to production team and get testing server 
similar to production server setup available . In this server test engineers will mainly 
focus on doing system testing

when to go for system testing:(*)
------------------------------
1) when minimum bunch of modules are ready.
2) Basic functionalities of all the modules should be working fine (FT and IT)
3) Product/sw should be relativly stable (No blocker defects)
4) Testing server similar to production server setup should be available.
5) when we start getting less number of requirements.

Assume that we are in 26th cycle and testing continues till 55th cycle:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Assume that we got module 'Q' and testing team will start to test module 'Q'

1) TE will do 'FT' for 'Q'
2) Integration testing between 'Q' with old modules.
3) System testing (A-Q)
4) Retest defects in old modules.
5) Test the old modules (A-P)

Like this way testing continues for many cycles and assume that we got module 'Z' in the 
50th cycle Now TE will test module 'Z' .Once after testing is completed for 'A-Z' modules. 
last 4-5 cycles requirements will be freezed developers will be fixing pending defects 
and TE will be testing the defects , at the end moment again TE will do FT,IT,ST 
for all (A-Z) modules and TE got to know sw quality is good , now testing team will talk 
to Test manager,Dev manager and PM stating sw quality is good , Finally sw will be 
deployed into the production server, so that customers can use sw and run the business. 
This is how system  testing works in the real time.

What is Release or 1st release
----------------------------------------
defintion:

Starting from gathering/collecting the requirements followed by developing the sw and
testing sw for many cycles and deploy the sw into the production server is called as 
'Release/1 Release'.

Note:
-----
1) If project is very big and complex in this case one project can hve multiple releases.
2) If project is very small and simple in this case one project can have one release.

When to release sw to customer?
1) when all the customer requested features are ready (A-Z)
2) when the product is functionally stable (good quality)
3) There should not be any Blocker/Critical defects.
4) Once after FT,IT and ST is done we can release sw to customer.
5) Once after sw is tested in Testing server similar  to the production Server.
6) Once after all the end to end scenarios are thoroughly tested.
7) when we are about to meet Deadline/release date given by the customer.
8) We can have some minor defects and these defects should not affect the 
  customer business workflows and this defects should be meet acceptable limit 
  set by the customer.


What do you mean by Testing server SIMILAR to Production server 
---------------------------------------------------------------
1) Hardware should be similar to the production server:
-------------------------------------------------------
a)manufacturer should be similar to Production Server
  If production server is manufactured by HP then Testing server similar to
  production server should be manufactured by HP only.

b)Configuration and make should be similar but we can have diffferent capacity..
  It means No of cpu and storage can be different

2)Software should be similar to the production server:
------------------------------------------------------
a) 'OS'should be similar
b) 'webserver' should be similar
c) 'App Server' Should be similar
d) 'DB Server' should be similar

3)Data should be similar to the production server:
--------------------------------------------------
Suppose if production server is having 10lakh/50,000 user accounts (Data) then in
testing server similar to production server Testing team should create
10lakh/50,000(data) similar dummy accounts (data) and test the sw.

Creating 10lakh/50,000 Dummy data manually is verytough job thats is the reason company 
will use performance testing tool to create huge data.


->what is Build
--------------------
We (Developers) will write the code, do wbt and compile the code and compress the code
into a file ,this compressed file is called as 'Build'.
We give the Build in below mentioned formats:
.exe
.zip
.jar (java archieve)
.war (web application acrchieve)
.tar (tap archieve)
.rar (roshal archieve)
.apk (android programming/packaging kit)
.ipa (IOS app archieve)

Note:
-----
- one project can consist of n number of builds.
- One project can have only 1 release ( if it is small and simple)
- one project can have n number of releases ( if it is big and complex project)
- Every release can have n number of builds.




->Re-spin/Unplanned Build
-------------------------
The process of getting a new build within the test cycle is called as 'Respin' It's also called as 'Unplanned Build'.
Note: One release can consist of n no of Re-spin.

Diagram for Re-Spin:
---------------------
 
Real time example for Respin:
-----------------------------
If you take gmail as an application, if Login module itself is not working then TE cannot continue the testing , In this case Developer will give 'Respin'.

->Patch:
--------
->Patch is the piece of software which consist of modified programmes.

->To install the patch it's not required to uninstall the build.

Diagram for patch
-----------------

Real time examples for patch:
------------------------------
Example: Whatsapp update,FB update, Phonepay update,etc....

Note:
-----
- Many lines of code problem means -->Respin
- Piece of code problem means---> Patch
- One Release can consist of n no of patch

-> CR (Change Request)
----------------------
when customer given requirements are not clear then immediatly customer will request for
company that he wants to change the requirement. This changed requirement is called as 
'CR'.

CR will be given before software is released to the customer.

-> RFE(Request for Enhancement)
-------------------------------
If TE finds a defect in the software and this defect is not part of the requirement then 
developer will tell it is an 'RFE'.

RFE can given by Customer,Sr TE, Sr Dev, BA and PM.


->HOT FIX/Incident(defect)management:
-------------------------------------
In the production server while using software and running business if customer finds 
any 'Blocker/Critical' defect then customer will immediatly communicate defect to the
company and in the company developers will immediatly fix the defect and TE will
immediatly test the defect and Patch will be given to the production server. 
This process is called 'Hot Fix'/'Incident Management'.

To work on the Hotfix max we will be having 1 or 2 hours , worst case 1 day time.

Short Release/Interim Release:
------------------------------
In production server while using sw and running business, if customer feels that he
wants to do some minor changes and if customer is facing some minor defects then customer 
will communicate to company, In the company we will select some set of developers and test
engineers where in developers will write the code for minor changes and fix the minor 
defects and give sw to Test engineers and test engineers will test the minor 
changes (FT,IT,ST) and test the minor defects and give sw to customer and 
customer will do Acceptance testing and deploy the sw into production server .
This entire process will be done just within 15 days or 1 month instead of taking an
year time.These kind of releases are called Short release or Interim Release.

Difference between Service based company & Product based company:
Service Based Company:
--------------------------------
1. Customer gives the requirement
2. BA will be present in service based company and he will do requirement collection
3. company will develop the software, test the software and give it back to the customer 
   who gave requirement
4. company don't have any rights to sell same software to other customer
5. company don't have any rights or authority to keep source code with them.
6. customer & projects are terms used in service based company.
ex: Infosys, Accenture, Wipro etc.,

Product Based Company:
1. Initially Customer will not be present.
2. PA (Product Analyst) will do market research and he will collect requirement.
3. company will develop the software, test the software and sell the software to multiple
    customer. 
4. company has got all the rights to sell same software to different customer
5. company has got all the rights or authority to keep source code with them.
6. client & product are terms used in product based company.
ex: FlipKart,Amazon, Apple,Sony,Benz, Volvo, Nokia,Samsung, Dell, Microsoft
